/**
  TTC - Time To Collision
  Ratio between relative distance between two vehicle and their relative velocity
  Assumptions:
  (1) npc in front of ego
  (2) npc and ego in the same lane
  (3) velocity of npc lower then velocity of ego
  If assumptions are violated, TTC = +inf (no collision can occur)
  Vanilla TTC ignore the effect of possible accelerations/decelerations between the two vehicles

  // Input, must match the key in the data file
  
  // Variables
  float relative_distance_ego_npc
  float velocity_ego
  float velocity_npc
  bool same_lane_ego_npc // +/- Inf? TODO: Check how cast the boolean, what happens to those variables at runtime

  // Constants
  const float safe_ttc = 3.5

  // Formulae
  bool cond
  
  // Assumption / Pre-condition
  cond = same_lane_ego_npc and velocity_ego > velocity_npc

  // Subformulae
  //...

  // Main Formula outputs the final robustness value
  // NOTE: In this example, there's no ALWAYS operator to plot the value of TTC over time.
  // -> is the implication =>

  // NOTE: DivByZero possible if condition is NOT met if velocity_ego == velocity_npc 
  cond -> ((relative_distance_ego_npc / (velocity_ego - velocity_npc)) >= safe_ttc)
