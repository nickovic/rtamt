/**
  TTC - Time To Collision
  Ratio between relative distance between two vehicle and their relative velocity
  Assumptions:
  (1) npc in front of ego
  (2) npc and ego in the same lane
  (3) velocity of npc lower then velocity of ego
  If assumptions are violated, TTC = +inf (no collision can occur)
  Vanilla TTC ignore the effect of possible accelerations/decelerations between the two vehicles
